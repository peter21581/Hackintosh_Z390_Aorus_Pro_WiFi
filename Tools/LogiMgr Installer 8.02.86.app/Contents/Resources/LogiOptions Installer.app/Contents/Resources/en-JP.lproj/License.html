conditions of this agreement. Logicool and its licensors retain ownership of
the Software and Logicool reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.  The
terms of this agreement will govern any software updates provided by Logicool

govern.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;License Grant and Restrictions.  Subject to
the terms and conditions of this agreement, Logicool grants to you a limited
nonexclusive license to use one copy of the Software only with the Logicool

you agree not to, or to enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted
by this agreement), decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or attempt to

You may make one copy of the Software for backup purposes, solely for use with

that any copies must include all copyright or other proprietary notices
contained on the original.  THE SOFTWARE IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN THE

PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>3.  Transfer.  You may not and you agree not to, or to
enable others to, sell, re-distribute, rent, lease or sublicense the Software, except
that if you purchased a Logicool product with this Software you may transfer

EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, YOUR USE OF THE LOGICOOL SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND
EFFORT IS WITH YOU. LOGICOOL AND ITS LICENSORS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES
AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LOGICOOL SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, EITHER
EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  LOGICOOL DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST
INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE LOGICOOL SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, THAT THE
FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE LOGICOOL SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR
REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE LOGICOOL SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE LOGICOOL SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED. </span><span lang=EN-US> NO LOGICOOL DEALER, AGENT,
OR EMPLOYEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATION, EXTENSION, OR ADDITION TO
THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusions of implied
warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of consumers, so the
above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT
PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LOGICOOL OR ITS LICENSORS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, LOST
PROFITS, LOSS OF INFORMATION OR DATA, OR ANY OTHER SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE SALE,
LICENSE OR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE ANY LOGICOOL PRODUCT OR SERVICE, HOWEVER
CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), EVEN
IF LOGICOOL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO CASE WILL
LOGICOOL'S AND ITS LICENSORS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED THE ACTUAL MONEY PAID FOR
THE LOGICOOL PRODUCT OR SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. <a
name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1">The foregoing limitations will apply
even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you. The above limitations will not apply in case of personal injury where and
to the extent that applicable law requires such liability.</a>  </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Government End Users. The Software is a
“Commercial Item”, as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of
“Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer Software
Documentation,” and is being licensed to U.S. Government end users (a) only as
Commercial Items, and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other
end users pursuant to the terms and conditions of this agreement. 
Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of the United States. </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Export Law Assurances. You agree that you may
not export or re-export the Software in violation of any applicable laws or
regulations including without limitation those of the United States of America,
the European Union, Switzerland and/or the laws or regulation of the jurisdiction(s)
in which the Software was obtained.  </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Agents and Third Party Purchasers. If you are
acquiring the Software on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and
warrant that you have the authority to bind the party or entity for which you
are acquiring the Software to the terms and conditions of this agreement.</span></p>

are in the U.S.A., this agreement will be exclusively governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California,
without regard to or application of its choice of law rules or principles.  If
you reside outside the U.S.A., this agreement will be exclusively governed by
the laws of Switzerland.    If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
finds any provision of this agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable,
that provision of the agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent
permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this
agreement will continue in full force and effect.  </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US>11.  Complete Agreement; Governing Language.  This
agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the use of the Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
understandings, communications or agreements, written or oral, regarding such
subject matter. No amendment to or modification of this agreement will be
binding unless in writing and signed by Logicool.  Any translation of this
agreement is done for local requirements and in the event of a dispute between
the English and any non-English version, the English version of this agreement
will govern.</span></p>

source components. If so, the open source portions of the Software are not
